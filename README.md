# My Data Journey

*Read this in other languages: [PortuguÃªs (Brasil)](README.pt.md)*

This is a repository to document and store my journey in the data world.

The plan is to reach a mid-level developer skill set in three semesters, starting from the basics.

For this, the **1st quarter** will be divided into 12 weeks with well-defined goals, considering my current level and available time.

### Weeks 1 & 2 - Basic Leveling

To review some concepts, I will start by revisiting the fundamentals of programming logic with Python. In parallel, I will learn the fundamentals of Git, which I had previously used superficially, almost like a "flash drive."

**Topics to be studied:**
* Variables
* Data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
* Operators
* Conditional structures (if/elif/else)
* Loops (for, while)
* What is code versioning?
* Essential terminal commands: `git init`, `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`.

**Practical goal of the week:**
The goal is to create this repository and, for each day of study, add a new `.py` file with the completed exercises. Each addition will be made through a `commit` with a clear message explaining the exercise, aiming to build a clean and organized history.
